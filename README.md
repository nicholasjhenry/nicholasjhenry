## Nicholas Henry: Senior Business Application Developer with Elixir and PostgreSQL

### About Me

I develop custom software that solves your complex business problems. By designing technical solutions, I optimize the specialized operations that your unique business uses to grow and thrive. I am an experienced business software developer with expertise in web applications, process automation, and complex workflows.

I build applications with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org), a modern programming language powered by [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org), a 30-year-old platform known for concurrency, distribution, and fault tolerance. I advocate for the Elixir programming language through the [Montreal Elixir](https://www.montrealelixir.ca) group, a local meetup which I co-founded.

[Event storming](https://www.eventstorming.com), [Story mapping](https://www.jpattonassociates.com/the-new-backlog/), and [Business Event Analysis and Modeling](https://modelstorming.com) are some tools I have adopted to clarify business processes and ensure software development efforts are focused on solving the right problem.

Learn more about me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholasjhenry/). Located in Montreal, QC, Canada.
