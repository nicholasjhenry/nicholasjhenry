## Nicholas Henry: Senior Business Application Developer with Elixir and PostgreSQL

### About Me

I develop custom software that solves complex business process problems. By designing technical solutions, I optimize the specialized operations that unique businesses use to grow and thrive. I am an experienced business software developer with expertise in web applications, process automation, and complex workflows.

I build applications with â€‹Elixirâ€‹, a modern programming language powered by â€‹Erlangâ€‹, a 30-year-old platform known for concurrency, distribution, and fault tolerance. I advocate for the Elixir programming language through the â€‹Montreal Elixir groupâ€‹, a local meetup in which he co-founded and is an active organizer.

Event storming, Story mapping, and Business Event Analysis and Modeling are some of the tools I have adopted to clarify business processes to ensure software development efforts are focused on solving the right problem.
